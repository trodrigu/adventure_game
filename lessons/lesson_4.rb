     Welcome to Level Four.
     You are now getting the hang of it!
     Looking a bit ahead you see a smoking bush!
     In your zeal you begin sprinting towards the bush!
     It is coming into sight and you see a left hand path.
     Looking down this way you spot that it is leading toward a dark valley.
     The path also shows a decline in elevation and seems as though as this could be the wrong way.
     Nevertheless we are standing by our decision from the README.
     There is also a trail sign next to the path that tells up something.
     Of course it is written in code and we must `decode` this.
     Since you are now use to using the irb this will be an easy task.

  def choices
    %w[
      You can see how object oriented really is and understand how everything (even operators) are objects.
      The choices you can think of are reduce, inject, and slap.

  def code
    %w[
      It says..
      The length of your path is =
      [1, 2, 3, 4].FILL_IN(:+)
      Miles
    ]

      puts "The success is real.  Congrats!!!!!!!  Just 10 more miles...TO BE CONTINUED"
      puts

      puts "You have the right idea but we just need a block instead."
