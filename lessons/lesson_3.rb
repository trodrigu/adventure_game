     Welcome to Level Three.
     The README you busted open does have an answer.
     The problem now is that it is presenting us an array of mismatched and mangled words.
     Run it in Ruby irb to determine the answer!

      At the bottom of the README it gives us choices for directions.
      They are right, left, and straight.
